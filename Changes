Revision history for RT-Extension-REST2

 - Accept 'Content' as a parameter on create. The documentation previously showed
   this in examples, but it wasn't yet supported. Now it works as documented.
 - Remove To and From from Create examples. These were documentation bugs since
   they were not supported via the API. Roles can be set using Requestor, Cc, etc.

   failures on install.
